    <title>Storing Power for Outages/Camping</title>
    <url>/2022/01/01/3-0-kWh-Solar-Generator/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This project was from the beginning of 2021. It took around 40 hours over a few months. It can store around 3 kWhs and has a max output of 2500 watts peak&#x2F;1500 watts continuous. It can run a campsite and be charged off of a laptop charger or solar panels&#x2F;wind generator â€“ anything that produces between 12 and 48 volts of power.</p>
<p>Most of the project is based on <a href="https://youtu.be/PVnQ87Fvsk4">LithiumSolar&#39;s video</a>.</p>
<p>Recycled 2200 mAh modem cells were sourced from <a href="batteryhookup.com">batteryhookup.com</a>. I&#39;ve sourced some 2600 mAh cells but not the 364 required for this project. The total storage of the generator ended up being a little less than 3.0 kWh after testing all cells.</p>

    <title>Monitoring CO2 Levels in Apartment or Car</title>
    <url>/2022/01/02/CO2-Monitor/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Inspiration for this project was <a href="https://makezine.com/fresh-air/">Makezine article and blog post &quot;Fresh Air&quot;</a> and <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-scd30">Adafruit&#39;s SCD-30 sensor page</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of interest in indoor CO2 monitoring was sparked by a professor that built a CO2 monitor for his classroom. He found that the CO2 levels at the end of class were enough to make you groggy&#x2F;sleepy and therefore not able to learn as well.</p>
<p>In my experimentation, an interesting discovery was the elevation of CO2 levels in a short drive with the windows up. My car, a Nissan Sentra, approached 2000 ppm in a one-person 30-minute commute. Having one window down @55 mph (90 kph) for a minute brought the levels back to below 1000 ppm.</p>

    <title>Learn 3D Modeling for Drone Build</title>
    <url>/2022/11/21/Learn-Drone-Building-and-3D-Modeling/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few of my projects have been held back because the cost of a chassis would double the cost of the project and still there aren&#39;t reliable&#x2F;customizable solutions for small and quick electronics projects that need a case. I have been using 3D printing to get roughly what I want but the time modeling would span hours and still felt like I wasn&#39;t using Fusion 360 to its full potential.</p>
<p>I decided to take <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cad-design-digital-manufacturing">CAD and Digital Manufacturing on Coursera</a>. The specialization deals with building a drone frame for Nylon printing.</p>
<p><u>Issues that cropped up during this project:</u><ol></p>
<li>The course looks to be from around 2018. FPV quadcopters have come a long way so sourcing parts was difficult for a novice. I ended up with parts with poor documentation</li>
<li>The model is too large for a typical 3d printer to print so it had to be broken into several parts (see Fusion snip below)</li>
<li>Nylon is not a very good material for drone frames. It flexes a lot and is heavy relative to strength. The frame flexing also makes it more difficult for the flight controller to assign thrust</li>
<li>The component tray model could not fit two 4S LiPos so it was redesigned</li></ol>

<p>It ended up flying. I think a voltage drop ended up crashing the flight controller making it unresponsive to remote control and the drone started drifting to the unknown. Luckily it hit a power line and I was able to recover it.<iframe width="1214" height="683" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV6d9KvX41s" title="Drone First Flight" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
