    <title>3.0 kWh Solar Generator</title>
    <url>/2022/01/01/3-0-kWh-Solar-Generator/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This project was from the beginning of 2021. It took around 40 hours over a few months.</p>
<p>Most of the project is based on <a href="https://youtu.be/PVnQ87Fvsk4">LithiumSolar&#39;s video</a>.</p>
<p>Recycled 2200 mAh modem cells were sourced from <a href="batteryhookup.com">batteryhookup.com</a>. Iâ€™ve sourced some 2600 mAh cells, but not the 364 required for this project. The total storage of the generator ended up being a little less than 3.0 kWh after testing all cells.</p>

    <title>CO2 Monitor</title>
    <url>/2022/01/02/CO2-Monitor/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Inspiration for this project was <a href="https://makezine.com/fresh-air/">Makezine article and blog post &quot;Fresh Air&quot;</a> and <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-scd30">Adafruit&#39;s SCD-30 sensor page</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of interest in indoor CO2 monitoring was sparked by a professor that built a CO2 monitor for his classroom. He found that the CO2 levels at the end of class were enough to make you groggy/sleepy and therefore not able to learn as well.</p>
<p>One interesting discovery was how high CO2 levels get in a short drive with windows up. My car, a Nissan Sentra, approached 2000 ppm in a one-person 30-minute commute. Having one window down @55 MPH (90 KPH) for a minute brought the levels back to below 1000 ppm.</p>
